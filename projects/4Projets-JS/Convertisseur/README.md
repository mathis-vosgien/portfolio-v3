# Currency Converter Setup Guide

If you encounter an error while fetching currency exchange rates, please follow these steps:

## Get Your API Key
1. Sign up for an account at [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/).
2. Navigate to the API key section and generate a new API key.

**Note:** The API is free but has a limited number of requests per day.

## Insert Your API Key
1. Open your project folder in VS Code.
2. Locate the `script.js` file in your project.
3. Find the `API_KEY` variable and replace `YOUR-API-KEY` with your actual API key.

## Save and Test

1. Save the `script.js` file after adding your API key.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser to test your currency converter and ensure it's functioning correctly.

If you still get an error or get stuck, feel free to message me on Buy Me a Coffee.
